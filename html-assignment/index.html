    <header>About Me</header>
    <main>
         <p>My name is Vincent. I am from China. The reason why I came to Canada is because the quality of education here is higher and I want to live in a relatively comfortable country. To be honest, it is my dream to come here.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I chose the  <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> major because I believe that more and more companies want to recruit <em>multi-faceted</em> talents, and nowadays, almost everyone uses media. In addition I am very interested in photography. I hope to learn more professional knowledge in school. this is 1<sup>st</sup> semester in program,so I really want to know how far I can reach.<blockquote>Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
